Opt-In Panda gives visitors a reason to subscribe right now in return to instant access to your valuable content (e.g. downloads, discounts, videos and so on).

Hide your premium content behind an optin form (subscription widget) and watch your email subscription rates burst through the roof. Easily create in-content freebies and serve them to your subscribers only.

With Opt-In Panda, you will be able:

- Effectively and easily convert visitors into subscribers.
- Build large mailing lists on MailChimp, Aweber, GetReponse (and other services).
- Send more emails and increase your income.

<h3>Single Opt-In, Double Opt-In and Quick Email Confirmation</h3>

The plugin equally well works with Single Opt-In (without email confirmation) and Double Opt-In (with email confirmation) modes. Only you decide which mode to use.

We done our best to make the Double Opt-In email confirmation process as quick and pleasant as possible.

<h3>Add Subscribers Directly To Your Favorite Mailing Service</h3>

The Opt-In Panda integrates directly with all the major mailing services and plugins: 

* MailChimp
* Aweber
* SendGrid
* SendinBlue
* MyMail
* MailPoet
* ActiveCampaign
* GetResponse
* Acumbamail

Also supports any transactional mailing services (for example, Mandrill, Postmark, Mailjet, Amazon SES) and SMTP after installing respective Wordpress plugins.

Moreover, the plugin saves all received email contacts locally in the database.

<h3>Track Your Results with Built-in Advanced Analytics</h3>

The plugin collects the full stats (impressions, conversions) on how your lockers perform on pages of your websites.

Easily identify which lockers on which pages are out-performing others, how to optimize your lockers and what you could do differently to improve your results.

<h3>Other Key Features</h3>
The plugin also is packaged with the following features:

* **SEO Friendly.** Your locked content is still visible for search bots for better SEO by default. Of course you can turn off this feature.

* **4 Types of Locks.** Lock any content manually via shortcodes or setup batch lock via one of 3 powerful modes (“Skip & Lock”, “More Tag”, “CSS Selector”).

* **Visual Composer.** The Opt-In Panda is fully compatible with the Visual Composer.

* **Optimized For Mobile.** We have adapted the plugin for mobile devices. Mobile users can obtain access to your locked content as well as desktop users.

* **Fast Loading.** The plugin is well optimized and doesn’t add extra loads on your website. Confirmed with tests from the P3 plugin and New Relic.

* **Developer Friendly.** Use the plugin events (Unlock, Lock, Ready) and hooks for customization and creating your own extensions.
